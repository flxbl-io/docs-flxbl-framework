# Minimal Framework

flxbl is designed with flexibility and adaptability at its core and is a **minimal framework,** this approach caters to a wide range of needs, from teams looking to gradually transition by using ideas/techniques selectively to those seeking to start a new Salesforce implementation using the framework holistically.

**Core Components:**

1. **Build Automation Engine:** At the core of flxbl is [sfp](https://docs.flxbl.io/sfp), a build automation engine can be seamlessly integrated into your existing workflows, requiring minimal modifications. Projects can utilize sfp immediately into their existing workflows as a drop in replacement for home grown scripts and/or commercial deployment tools.
2. **CI/CD Workflows: sfops** is a collection of reusable Github Actions, Reusable Workflows along with a Github pages hosted website which aims to convert your Github Org  for Salesforce as your ultimate automation and control centre for your developers &#x20;
3. **IDE**:  **codev** is ultimate companion desktop app for your developers  allowing your team members to collaborate with ease in realtime across a flxbl project
4. **Tools:** These are standalone utilities (curated from community)  that can be integrated into existing workflows to enhance productivity or introduce new capabilities without significant changes to current practices.
5. **Techniques:** This component encompasses best practices, methodologies, and patterns that teams can adopt to improve their development processes. It's designed to be adopted gradually, allowing teams to evolve their practices at a comfortable pace.
6. **Libraries:** A collection of reusable code that can be directly incorporated into projects to provide specific functionalities. These libraries are designed to be loosely coupled, ensuring that they can be used independently or in combination without significant dependency issues.

**Adoption Path:**

The adoption pathway for flxbl is inherently flexible.

* Teams looking for immediate productivity gains might start with **sfp** and the selection of tools, integrating them into their existing workflows with minimal disruption.
* Those focused on long-term process improvement might adopt **Techniques** next, gradually refining their development practices.
* As projects grow in complexity, teams can integrate **Libraries**, leveraging reusable code to accelerate development and reduce redundancy.
