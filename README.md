# Introduction

**flxbl** complements the [Salesforce Well-Architected Framework](https://architect.salesforce.com/well-architected/overview) by providing a practical implementation roadmap tailored to Salesforce development teams. While the Well-Architected Framework outlines the principles and best practices for building robust, efficient, and secure Salesforce solutions, flxbl offers the tools and methodologies to put these principles into action. It bridges the gap between theoretical guidance and practical application, ensuring that teams not only understand what constitutes a well-architected Salesforce solution, but also have the means to achieve it through efficient DevOps practices and collaborative workflows.

## When to use flxbl?

Flxbl is the optimal choice for your team in the following scenarios:

* Your team values the advantages of modular development within Salesforce and seeks to implement these principles effectively.
* Flxbl is designed for teams who are on a high throughput release frequency, however Flxbl can be adapted to be used for milestone based delivery
* Flxbl is designed to be user-friendly for teams new to version control, however some experience with usage of version control, terminal, salesforce command line interface (sf cli) etc is necessary
* **You are not looking for DevOps tools, but an overall approach to modular development.**
* You are looking for a framework that ushers in having the overall team to handle end to end visibility and ownership
