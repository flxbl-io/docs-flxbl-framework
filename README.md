  Welcome to flxbl,  flxbl is an opinionated framework for developing and
  maintaining a composable Salesforce Org.

# Introduction

**flxbl** complements the [Salesforce Well-Architected Framework](https://architect.salesforce.com/well-architected/overview) by providing a practical implementation roadmap tailored to Salesforce development teams. While the Well-Architected Framework outlines the principles and best practices for building robust, efficient, and secure Salesforce solutions, flxbl offers the tools and methodologies to put these principles into action. It bridges the gap between theoretical guidance and practical application, ensuring that teams not only understand what constitutes a well-architected Salesforce solution, but also have the means to achieve it through efficient DevOps practices and collaborative workflows.

### Who This Is For (And Who It Isn't)

Flxbl transforms development teams, but it's not for everyone:

**Flxbl is ideal for teams that:**

* Want to improve deployment reliability immediately (even with monolithic - "Happy Soup" - orgs)
* Are tired of environment management overhead
* Deploy to production regularly or want to deploy more frequently
* Want to implement proper CI/CD practices
* Are considering or planning modular architecture
* **Are using or planning to use AI development tools** (this is increasingly everyone)
* **Need to maintain quality while increasing development velocity**
* Want the option to refactor safely as business needs evolve

**Flxbl might be overkill if you:**

* Have a single developer working part-time with very simple configurations
* Deploy infrequently (quarterly or less) with minimal changes
* Are completely satisfied with your current deployment success rates and development velocity
* Are constrained by organizational policies that prevent modern development practices
* **Are committed to maintaining current development velocity regardless of AI capabilities**

Flxbl provides immediate benefits for monolithic orgs while creating a clear path toward modularity when it makes business sense.
