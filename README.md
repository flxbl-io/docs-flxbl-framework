# Introduction

**flxbl** complements the Salesforce Well-Architected Framework by providing a practical implementation roadmap tailored to Salesforce development teams. While the Well-Architected Framework outlines the principles and best practices for building robust, efficient, and secure Salesforce solutions, flxbl offers the tools and methodologies to put these principles into action. It bridges the gap between theoretical guidance and practical application, ensuring that teams not only understand what constitutes a well-architected Salesforce solution, but also have the means to achieve it through efficient DevOps practices and collaborative workflows.

## How is flxbl connected to DX@Scale?

The transition from DX@Scale to **flxbl** was driven by the need for clarity in ownership and the desire to expand beyond just being a DevOps tool. Originating as an open-source project, it grew into a substantial community. The move to **flxbl**, aims to facilitate broader participation and innovation in Salesforce implementations. This rebranding will involve updating community branding, documentation, and tools, with new features. The initiative underscores a commitment to independence and the enhancement of Salesforce solution delivery through open-source collaboration.
